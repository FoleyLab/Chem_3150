    "1.\tThis experiment consists of an experimental setup to determine the PVT behavior of air.\n",
    "The experiment will introduce students to the statistical analysis of data sets. For this purpose, in this and all experiments of CHEM 3150, the results from each group will be shared and each group will statistically analyze all the data points.\n",
    "2.\tThe experiment, data cataloging, analysis, and reporting of data will be the result of group effort.  However, students will prepare their reports individually, their abstracts, introductions, data analysis, discussion, and conclusions should reflect individual effort.\n",
    "3.\tSeveral Discussion Questions (Q1, Q2, etc) are included in this document; these questions should be answered in the lab write up in the introduction and/or discussion sections, as appropriate.  You may use time in lab to talk through these questions with your peers and your professor, but you should write the answers up on your own in your final report.\n"

    "\n",
    "Gases can be described with a good deal of accuracy by the kinetic model based on statistical mechanics and the Boltzmann probability distribution.  The Boltzmann probability distribution relates the probability of a system at equilibrium with temperature $T$ being in a state $j$ with energy $E_j$ as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_j \\propto e^{\\frac{-E_j}{k_B T}} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Under this assumption, the distribution of kinetic energy follows the Maxwell-Boltzman’s distribution of velocities.\n",
    "Implicit in such model are the following assumptions:\n",
    "- There are no intermolecular forces between the gas molecules.\n",
    "- The gas molecules collisions are random and elastic\n",
    "- There are no internal molecular degrees of freedom (i.e. no vibrations or rotations); only translational degrees of freedom are present.  \n"

    "**Question 3:**  How can you specify a state for 100 ideal gas particles?  How can you assign an internal energy $U$ to that particular state?\n",
    " \n",
    "Under this assumption the state equation for an ideal gas is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P V = n R T $$\n",
    "Where: $n$ is the number of moles and $R$ is a proportionality constant, which is found to be the same for any gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4:** What are the dimensions of $R$?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5:** What is the value of $R$ in SI units?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal gas equation is the state equation of the gas system in the sense that instead of solving the discrete Newton’s equations for each molecule we describe the behavior of the system as a function of state variables $P,V,n,$ and $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6:** Why can we do such “globalization” and when it will fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7:** What happens if the system is not in equilibrium?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, real gases can only be approximately described by the ideal gas law, and the approximation tends to work well when experiments are performed under suitable conditions.  In particular, the ideal gas law tends to work well when the pressure of the gas is low, and temperatures are above vaporization temperature. Nevertheless, provided these conditions are satisfied, most gases do conform quite well to the ideal gas equation with about the same proportionality constant for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure of how well a real gas behaves as ideal gas is to measure $P, V,$ and $T,$ and see how close $\\frac{RT}{PV}$ is to 1. The quantity $\\frac{RT}{PV}$ is known as the compression factor, and is often given the symbol $Z$. \n",
    "For most real gases at very high pressures (a few hundred atmospheres), it is found in fact that $Z$ is rather greater than 1. As the pressure is lowered, $Z$ decreases and becomes slightly less than 1. Then at yet lower pressures $Z$ rises again. The exact shape of the $Z$ vs. $P$ curve is different from gas to gas, as is the pressure at which $Z$ is a minimum. Yet, for all gases, as the pressure approaches zero, $\\frac{PV}{nT}$ approaches $R$ exactly.\n",
    "Another way to look at how closely real gases obey the ideal gas equation is to plot $P$ vs. $V$ for a number of different temperatures. That is, we draw a set of isotherms. For an ideal gas, these isotherms, $PV = \\; constant$, are rectangular hyperbolas. So they are for real gases at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, departures from the ideal gas equation are marked. Typical isotherms are sketched in Figure 1. "

    "In the PV plane of Figure 1, you will see several areas marked \"gas\", \"liquid\", \"vapour\", \"liquid + vapour\" (State diagram for the compound). You can follow the behavior at a given temperature by starting at the right-hand end of each isotherm, and gradually moving to the left – i.e. increase the pressure and decrease the volume. The high temperature isotherm is nearly hyperboloidal (ideal gas behavior). Nothing special happens beyond the volume decreasing as the pressure is increased, according to Boyle's law. \n",
    "At slightly lower temperatures, a kink develops in the isotherm, and at the critical temperature (marked CI on the graph)  the $P$ vs $V$ curve shows a local horizontal inflection point. The isotherm for the critical temperature is the critical isotherm. Still nothing special happens other than $V$ decreasing as $P$ is increased, though not now according to Boyle's law.\n",
    "For temperatures below the critical temperature, we refer to the gas as a vapour. As you decrease the volume, the pressure gradually increases until you reach the dashed curve. At this point, some of the vapour liquefies, and, as you continue to decrease the volume, more and more of the vapour liquefies, the pressure remaining constant while it does so. That is the horizontal portion of the isotherm. In that region (i.e. outlined by the dashed curve) we have liquid and vapour in equilibrium. Near the right-hand end of the horizontal portion, there is just a small amount of liquid; at the left-hand end, most of the substance is liquid, with only a small amount of vapour left.\n",
    "After it is all liquid, further increase of pressure barely decreases the volume, this is because liquids have a very small compressibility. The isotherm is then almost vertical.\n",

Some of these attempts have been purely empirical attempts to fit a mathematical formula to real data. Others are the result of at least an attempt to describe some physical model that would explain the behavior of real gases.

    "3.\tHolding the two or three ballast SS bars against the outside of the graduate cylinder (on the area where the previous rubber bands are located), secure the bars with two additional rubber bands to hold the SS bars against the graduate cylinder (See Figure 3).\n",
    "4.\tFill each graduated cylinders with water up to about 2/3 of its capacity (See Table 1 for approximate values) Introduce each cylinder inverted into the water tank (See Figure 1) by closing the front with your hand or a rubber stopper. Do not remove your hand or stopper until the end of the graduate cylinder is submerged in the tank’s water. Failing to do so will cause the graduate cylinder to empty and you will have to start over.\n",
    "5.\tOnce all three cylinders are set, we will collect data for five different temperatures from hot to cold as follows:\n",
    "6.\tEmpty the water tank (e.g. by syphoning) until the water level is close to the graduated cylinders end; refill the tanks with very hot water from the faucet.\n",
    "7.\tSet up the thermometer so that the tip is close to the area where the graduated cylinders are located.\n",
    "8.\tBe sure that the graduated cylinders are oriented such that you can read the bubble air volume from outside the water tank.\n",
    "9.\tOnce the temperature of the bath is stable, wait at least 1 minute, record the $T_{bath}$ (in C), water column height ($H_{wc}$),  and $V_{bubble}$ (in mL) of the air bubbles in each graduated cylinder\n",
    "10.\tRepeat *2* to *4* by siphoning hot water out  and adding cold water.\n",
    "11.\tAfter the temperature in the tank is about 30-40$^{\\circ}$ C, remove water (e.g. by syphoning) and add ice to cool the setup below room temperature.  Collect two more data points, with the final data point at $T\\approx 0^{\\circ}$C (ice bath conditions).\n",
