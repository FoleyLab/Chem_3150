    "#### WPU-CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT\n",
    "**BACKGROUND:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The inter-dissolution of two substance is a phenomenon controlled by a reduction of free energy (either Gibbs or Helmholtz), as such it has an enthalpy and entropy components.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two factors that can drive processes to occur. The first is the heat exchanged as a result of the process. This is referred to as the “change in enthalpy” and sometimes as “the heat of reaction”. If heat is released in the process ($\\Delta H < 0$), it favors the feasibility of the reaction to occur. The second is the change in the state of order in the system. This is referred to as the “change in entropy”. A process that results in a more disordered state (higher number of configurational states available) favors spontaneity ($\\Delta S \\ge 0$) as per the Second Law of Thermodynamics. These two factors will contribute to define the free energy of the system (either Gibbs or Helmholtz) and determining whether a process is indeed spontaneous. The change in Gibbs free energy (G) which is a function of the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$) and the change in entropy ($\\Delta S$). If $\\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction occurs spontaneously otherwise it does not occur spontaneously. Thus, any spontaneous endothermic process has to be driven by a positive change in entropy,\n",
    "$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that even though the reaction may occurs spontaneously, the change in $G$ does not tell anything about the rate of the reaction or the kinetics of the reaction. The later are controlled by reaction kinetic factors.\n",
    "Intermolecular interaction between the substances play a role in the miscibility of two substances. The miscibility of polar solvents, such as water and ethanol are based, in part, on hydrogen bonding. Pure water exists as spheres of 10-30 water molecules held together via hydrogen bonds. Pure ethanol is similar, but generally the clusters of ethanol are smaller. As we will soon verify, these two solvents are completely miscible in all proportions. \n",
    "What happens to the intermolecular bonding structure when these two solvents are mixed? Some water-water hydrogen bonds and ethanol-ethanol hydrogen bonds are broken and some water-ethanol hydrogen bonds are formed. The process of breaking bonds is endothermic (heat is absorbed by the molecules and the energy is used to break the bonds). The process of making bonds is exothermic (heat is released). By measuring the temperature change of the solutions upon mixing, one can assess whether a net number of hydrogen bonds were formed or broken upon mixing. Because molecules that are on the inside of the sphere are generally involved in more hydrogen bonding than those on the surface of the sphere, an exothermic mixing suggests that bigger clusters were formed and an endothermic mixing suggests that mixing has resulted in smaller solvent clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, more configurational states are available (water-ethanol states) for each molecule that the original water-water and ethanol-ethanol ones. Therefore, entropy increases after the dissolution of the two substances.\n",
    "Similarly rationale may be used from non-polar substances but considering dispersion forces instead.  A broader scope of the phenomena occurs when all inter-molecular forces discussed in College Chemistry are considered.\n",
    "Question1: In College Chemistry we learn a definition of solvation; however, the molecular mechanism of dissolution to achieve solvation in the case of a solid-liquid or liquid-liquid was never touched. Search/investigate for the molecular mechanism that allows solvation to happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can realize that even if no interactions occur between the molecules, the mixing of two substance may occur due to the entropic contribution lowering the Gibbs free energy.\n",
    "For an ideal solution of liquid 1 and liquid 2 the following applies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta H_{mix} = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the only component of the free energy is the one related to entropy:\n",
    "$$ \\Delta G_{mix} = RT \\left(\\chi_1 Ln( \\chi_1) + \\chi_2 Ln(\\chi_2) \\right) $$              \n",
    "Where $\\chi$ are the molar fractions of the corresponding liquid\n",
    "Additionally from College Chemistry you are familiar with the relationship between heat flow and specific heat capacity ($C_s$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q  = m C_s \\Delta T    $$                                 \n",
    "\n",
    "The net heat flow/change from the dissolution process can be calculated using this relationship when the amount of one of the substances dissolved (solute) is small compared to the amount of the other one (solvent) or what is called a diluted solution. \n",
    "Question2: In this laboratory we will be considering solutions which are not considered “diluted”, how you deal with the heat flow calculations in such situations?\n",
    "Preparing for this laboratory, read the following material:\n",
    "a)\tChapter 6,  Sections 6.5 to 6.6 and Chapter 9, Sections 9.1 to 9.3 from the Physical-Chemistry text book\n",
